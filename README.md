# Discrete Geometry and Images Project - Counting and Measuring Grains

## Project Description
This project involves the analysis of three different types of rice grains: Basmati rice, Camargue rice, and Japanese rice. The main objective is to count the grains, extract their boundaries, polygonize these boundaries, and calculate various properties such as area, perimeter, and circularity. This analysis is carried out using the DGtal (Digital Geometry Tools and Algorithms Library).

## Implementation
- **Step 1 (Download and Observation of Segmented Images):** Installation of the DGtal library and downloading the RiceGrains.zip file containing the original color images and their segmented binary images of the three types of rice grains.
- **Step 2 (Counting Grains):** Reading binary images, converting them to digital sets, and constructing digital objects. Counting grains and eliminating ill-composed grains.
- **Step 3 (Extraction of Digital Object Boundaries):** Extraction of contours for each grain using the DGtal library.
- **Step 4 (Polygonization of Digital Object Boundaries):** Polygonization of grain boundaries to obtain polygonal shapes.
- **Step 5 (Calculation of Area):** Calculating the area of each grain using two different methods and analyzing the results.
- **Step 6 (Calculation of Perimeter):** Calculating the perimeter of each grain using two different methods and analyzing the results.
- **Step 7 (Proposal and Calculation of Circularity):** Proposing a circularity measure and calculating circularity for each grain.
